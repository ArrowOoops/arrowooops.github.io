## Yixin Jie(揭一新)

Hi! I am a second year M.S. at University of Science and Technology of China, the department of Cyberspace Science and Technology, advised by [Chi Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chizhang/). I work on Federated Learning of Graph Neural Network.

I did my undergrad at University of Science and Technology of China, the department of The Gifted Young, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I did my undergraduate thesis on Computer Vision, afiliated with the Knowledge and Data Engineering Laboratory. I am advised by A.P [Shouhong Wan](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0906/c23239a460133/page.htm). I work on one-stage Object Detection on Remote Sensing Image.
